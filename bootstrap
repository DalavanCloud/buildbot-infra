# This script invokes bootstrap.yml while settings special parameters

# Usage: ./bootstrap [-i <inventory>] -k <ansible-playbook-options>
#
# -i <inventory> is needed when you deploy on hosts other than listed in 'dev-hosts'
# 
# Note: `-k` option would require a sshpass program.  For some reason, this
# approach hangs on Dustin and Mikhail.  As a workaround, the `ControlPersist`
# parameter below is set to 10m, so ssh would keep the connection after the
# first authentication.
