Notes For Upgrading FreeBSD
===========================

Much of this document is based on the Handbook, section 24.6 Rebuilding World.
That should be the primary source to use when upgrading.

# Update /usr/src. It is a git clone of a mirror on github.

# Start a script session to log everything for review.
script /var/tmp/mw.out
chflags -R noschg /usr/obj/*
rm -rf /usr/obj

cd /usr/src
make -j8 buildworld
make -j8 buildkernel KERNCONF=$kernel
make installkernel KERNCONF=$kernel
mergemaster -Fp
make installworld
mergemaster -iFU
yes | make delete-old

ezjail-admin update -i

# For each jail directory:
mergemaster -FU -D /path/to/jail

reboot

# Wait for machine to come back.

# Resume script output from before.
script -a /var/tmp/mw.out
cd /usr/src
make delete-old-libs

pkg upgrade

# For each jail directory:
# CAVEAT: mailman (in the lists jail) MUST be upgraded via ports.
jexec $jid pkg upgrade
