Don't Know How To..
-------------------

* handle secrets
* purge unhandled things (users)
  (apparently not supported directly by ansible; workarounds involve lots of
  scripting)

Bootstrapping Ideas
-------------------

Logging in remotely is hard -- probably non-priv SSH + `su -`.  Can ansible do
that?

Ah, see http://lampros.chaidas.com/index.php/2014/06/ for raw mode

Need 'pkg install python ansible' -- ansible only dep's python2-2_3, which
doesn't have /usr/local/bin/python
