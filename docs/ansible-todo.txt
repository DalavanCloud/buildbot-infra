---------------------------------

(based on discussion in https://github.com/buildbot/buildbot-infra/pull/12)

* run under service account [done]
* ensure path does not depend on external configuration [done]
* run daily [done] (actually, it now runs hourly)
* document a way to "force" a run
* collect logs and send a notification in case of errors
