/*
    Modern versions of BIND use a random UDP port for each outgoing
    query by default in order to dramatically reduce the possibility
    of cache poisoning.  All users are strongly encouraged to utilize
    this feature, and to configure their firewalls to accommodate it.

    AS A LAST RESORT in order to get around a restrictive firewall
    policy you can try enabling the option below.  Use of this option
    will significantly reduce your ability to withstand cache poisoning
    attacks, and should be avoided if at all possible.

    Replace NNNNN in the example with a number between 49160 and 65530.
