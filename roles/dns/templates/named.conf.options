    Modern versions of BIND use a random UDP port for each outgoing

    of cache poisoning.  All users are strongly encouraged to utilize
    this feature, and to configure their firewalls to accommodate it.

    policy you can try enabling the option below.  Use of this option
    will significantly reduce your ability to withstand cache poisoning
    attacks, and should be avoided if at all possible.
